My journey to Computer Science
======
My academic journey is anything but conventional. As a freshman at **National Taiwan University (NTU)**, I excelled in my Chemical Engineering studies. However, I felt a disconnect between my natural aptitude for engineering and my passions for Computer Science. It was the magnetic pull of software and computing that truly kindled my intellectual curiosity.

Heeding this internal calling, I made a decisive move. I chose to **drop out** from NTU and ventured halfway across the world to the U.S. (And fortunately my parents are very open-minded and didn't beat me up for dropping out of college.) This decision led me to spend a year and a half honing my CS fundamental skills at **De Anza College** before transferring to Georgia Tech. 


Software Engineering
=====
I have experience across all levels of Software Development, from low-level C/C++ programming to Golang/Docker/Kubernetes/AWS infrastructure to fullstack development with Node.js, React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, tRPC to AI/LLM with LangChain, Pandas to Web3 smart contract and zero-knowledge proof. 

However, I'm gradually shifting my focus towards fullstack **AI/LLM** application/product development.
