Abstract:

Traditional assessment methods like multiple-choice exams offer scalability but fall short in
measuring depth of understanding. Essay exams, meanwhile, struggle against the rising tide
of AI assistance, such as ChatGPT, undermining their efficacy.

Interview-style oral assessments emerge as the pinnacle of learning evaluation, achieving
unmatched depth, precision, and authenticity in measuring understanding. Yet, time and
logistical challenges of implementing oral assessments on a large scale have hindered their
widespread adoption.

The dawn of Generative AI and Large Language Models heralds a new era. We stand at a
pivotal moment, equipped with the technology to harness the full potential of oral
assessments without the prohibitive costs and time constraints of the past.

In this talk, Ray will share his journey on implementing AI-powered Oral Assessment at Georgia Tech as well as how such technology can be used in corporate context.
