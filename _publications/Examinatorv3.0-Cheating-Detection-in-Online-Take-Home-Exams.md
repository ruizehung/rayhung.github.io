excerpt: 'Examinator v3.0 detects cheating in online take-home exams by comparing answers and the timestamps they were entered. A web interface enables efficient manual inspection. Use of the tool reveals that certain question types substantially enhance cheating detection, demonstrating the potential of automated algorithmic detection at scale. Examinator v3.0 has analyzed 915,831 pairs of exam submissions across three courses over two semesters at a top U.S. institution, identifying 46 instances of cheating.'
