I got introduced to Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof through Nucelo's buildathon. And then I was very fortunate to be able to attend [zkWeek in the Pit](https://jumpcrypto.com/thepit/zkweek/) hosted by Jump Crypto to learn from world-class ZK researchers and experts ðŸ˜†

During the events, I came up with the idea of Zlind, an online forum leveraging zero-knowledge (ZK) proof to enable people to share and connect fearlessly and anonymously. Essentially, it is a ZK version of [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/).

People can sign-up using their work or school email, post or comment anonymously while proving that they belong to a specific company or school, and optionally reveal themselves later on if they want. 

I used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, Prisma, Supabase, and [Semaphore ZK protocol](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/).

I have a prototype and will open source it sometime soon : ) Stay tuned!
