This is a team project for the CS 4641 Machine Learning course at Georgia Institute of Technology. I trained various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models, including AlexNet, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2, using preprocessed data. Notably, the MobileNetV2-based model achieved an accuracy of 92.8%, surpassing previous literature by [Rafi et al. (2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9033031) and being 98% smaller in size.

See [https://cbc32.github.io/](https://cbc32.github.io/) for details.
