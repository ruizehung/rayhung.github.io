We are working on [Socratic Mind](https://www.socraticmind.com/), which uses AI to conduct interactive oral assessments leveraging **Socratic questioning** to challenge students to **think critically**, **articulate ideas verbally**, and **solve problems creatively**. As AI increasingly handles routine tasks and knowledge, we think it’s crucial to nurture self-questioning, self-reflection, logic, creativity, and judgment — skills where AI cannot easily match humans and are essential in the era of AI.

Our proposal has passed the initial phase of [The Learning Engineering Tools Competition, a multi-million dollar competition for edtech innovation](https://tools-competition.org/). We have received interest from professors at various institutions (Gatech, UCLA, UC San Diego, UW-Madison, Georgia State, University of Denver, University of New Hampshire, University of Lander).

We are working on a prototype! Stay tuned!
