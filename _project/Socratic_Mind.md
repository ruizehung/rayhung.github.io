I'm working on [Socratic Mind](https://www.socraticmind.com/), an AI-powered oral assessment platform leveraging Socratic questioning to challenge students to **explain**, **justify**, and even **defend** their answers to showcase their understanding. We believe that if you truly understand a concept, you should be able to explain it.
