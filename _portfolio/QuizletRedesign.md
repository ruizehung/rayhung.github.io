This is a group project in CS 6460 Educational Technology: Conceptual Foundations where we redesigned the Quizlet website. We think that the current Quizlet website lack the functionality to 
- Reorganize cards 
- Adapt questions based on student comprehension
- Provide hints that activate prior knowledge effectively
- Apply context to the topic being studied
- Use a white board

We added five new features:
1. Ordering Card/Question Type that allows users to specify a sequence of steps to recall. 
2. Dynamic Questioning Based on Misconceptions 
3. Enhanced Flashcards with Hints and Prompts related to prior knowledge
4. Contextual Learning Opportunities 
5. Interactive White Board

In particular, the feature I worked on is the Ordering Card/Question Type. My inspiration comes from primary reading that 
- Emphasizes distintion between declarative v.s. procedural knowledge 
- Procedural knowledge is more strongly correlated with math learning outcome (i.e. final grade) than declarative knowledge. [Hailikari et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2007.07.007)

Some learning science theories justification:
- Distintion between declarative knowledge v.s. procedural knowledge
- Testing is one of the most effective techniques of studying.
- Spaced repetition and repeated practice are effective learning strategies.
